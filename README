This is README for mvn-scaffold.

1. Locate src in ./src

Source flies located within ./src will be build.

2. Locate jar in ./repo

jar files located within ./repo will be abled to be
refered as repository in pom.xml.

For example:

$ ls -R ./repo
org

repo/org:
xxx

repo/org/xxx:
somelib

repo/org/xxx/somelib:
x.x.x

repo/org/xxx/some-lib/x.x.x:
somelib-x.x.x.jar           somelib-x.x.x.pom.md5
somelib-x.x.x.pom           somelib-x.x.x.pom.sha1

.md5 and .sha1 can be generated by md5sum and sha1sum command.
About pom, see ./repo/sample.pom.

If you specify this lib on pom.xml dependency entry,
jar will be registerd on local repository.

3. Write pom.xml

Specify each property, repository and dependencies.

4. Build

You can start building.
