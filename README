This is README for mvn-scaffold.

1. Locate src in ./src/main/java

Source flies located in ./src/main/java will be build.
Test codes should be located in ./test.

2. Locate jar in ./repo

jar files located within ./repo will be abled to be
refered as repository in pom.xml.

For example:

$ ls -R ./repo
org

repo/org:
dummy

repo/org/dummy:
dummy

repo/org/dummy/dummy:
x.x.x

repo/org/dummy/dummy/x.x.x:
dummy-x.x.x.jar           dummy-x.x.x.pom.md5
dummy-x.x.x.pom           dummy-x.x.x.pom.sha1

.md5 and .sha1 can be generated by md5sum and sha1sum command.

If you specify this lib on pom.xml dependency entry,
jar will be registerd on local repository.

3. Write pom.xml

Specify each property, repository and dependencies.
If you execute as jar, don't specify 'mainClass' entty in maven-assembly-plugin.

4. Build

You can start building as:

$ mvn package

5. Execute

$ java -jar xxx-jar-with-dependencies.jar xxx.SomeMainClass
